# PowershellProfiles
## A collection of my Powershell profiles/associated modules. They suck, don't copy them.

These are the Powershell profiles/modules I use primarily for Service Desk work, which is to say this repo contains a profile and the modules that I slot into the profile. They are not particularly good nor clever, but they are the result of my own tinkering rather than wholesale copying of other people's work. Therefore, I have to confess some pride in them. They have been sanitized of any information that makes them specific to any one company.

To provide flexibility and modularity, as well as allow different profiles to use a shared pool of functions, I leverage modules. Not much more to say. They are constantly getting updated and upgraded, and sometimes I come back to clean them up so they don't look so absolutely awful.
All jokes aside, it's possible there is some value here for someone working on the Service Desk. These tools can be improved, I know for a fact, I am always learning, but some of these have worked fine for me for over a year, and may serve as a good inspiration if you're a SD Technician who wants to try and make things a bit easier.
